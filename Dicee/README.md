# Dicee ðŸŽ²

## My Goal

The objective of this prooject is core programming concepts that will form the foundation of most of the apps Iâ€™ll build in the future.


## What did I create

Iâ€™m going to make a Las Vegas dice app. You can make the dice roll at the press of a button. With this app in your pocket, youâ€™ll be able to settle any score on the go!
